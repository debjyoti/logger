1. Add tests to testsuite:
	a. multi-threaded
	b. forked
2. Compare performance with log4c, zlog(HardySimpson), pantheios,
logprintf and zlog(zma)
3. Check race conditions using some tool like Valgrind.
4. Check memory leaks using some tool.
5. How to flush buffer in case of sudden exit due to error.
6. Handle signals. Flush buffer when ctrl^c is done.
7. Test if sched_yield works in AIX. Or should I use
pthread_yield() or sleep(1)?
8. If debug is set, use mutex ERRORCHECK, to find any deadlock
situations.
9. Add rc checks everywhere.
